# ⚙️ Installation

This project is developed as an extension for Nerfstudio. To get started, please install [Nerfstudio](https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/nerfstudio/tree/2adcc380c6c846fe032b1fe55ad2c960e170a215) along with its dependencies. <br>

</p>

Then, install this repo with:

```bash
pip install -e .
ns-install-cli
```

🚀 This will install the package in editable mode and kick off the Nerfstudio CLI installer to get you all set up and ready to go! 🎉

> Note: If for some reason the method is not working right away for you it may mean tat you have to compile the OptiX code for your specific machine. In order to do so please refer to this [instruction](docs/installation.md).

# Running the demo
To test if everything was installed properly, you can run the `ficus` demo.
First, download the demo dataset.
Install [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) 
```bash
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/datasets/MikolajZ/iris_demo_data
```

Place the `data` and `blender` folder into `iris`.

```bash
# First train the model with
ns-train iris --data data/ficus --timestamp iris_demo

# Prepare the animation with blender
blender -b blender/ficus/Ficus.blend -P blender/ficus/script.py

# Downscale and reformat animation
iris-export ply-from-obj --batch-folder blender/ficus/plys --gausses-per-face 1 --output-folder outputs/ficus/iris/iris_demo/reference_meshes --ply-mode True

# Export triangle soup
iris-export triangles --load-config outputs/ficus/iris/iris_demo/config.yml

# Bind triangle soup with animation and get final edits
iris-export ply-from-edits --load-config outputs/ficus/iris/iris_demo/config.yml

# Now you can render the animation
iris-render dataset --load-config outputs/ficus/iris/iris_demo/config.yml --rendered-output-names rgb --output-path edits/iris_demo --selected-camera-idx 50

# Render the video
ffmpeg -framerate 24 -i %05d.jpg -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p ficus_wind.mp4
```

# Data preparation
### Synthetic data
By default, our method supports the NeRF Synthetic format. If you want to use your own data you need to put `sparse_pc.ply` in the dataset folder. For synthetic data we used [LagHash](https://github.com/theialab/lagrangian_hashes) to generate the initial point cloud but COLMAP sparse point cloud works just as fine if you don't want to train another model.

### Real data
For real data please follow [Nerfstudio data format](https://docs.nerf.studio/quickstart/data_conventions.html). Like with synthetic data, you'll also need to place `sparse_pc.ply` in the dataset folder to initialize the network with a sparse point cloud.

### Replicating results from the paper
If you want to replicate the results that we showed in the paper you can download all our datasets with:
```bash
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/datasets/MikolajZ/iris_data
```
You will also find there all the config files we have used for training so you can use the same hyperparameters as we did. In [dataset `README.md`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MikolajZ/iris_data) you will find the description of the dataset content and tips for training the models.

# Training the network

Example train commands:
``` bash
# For nerf synthetic
ns-train iris --data <path_to_dataset>

# For MiP-NeRF but also other real data
ns-train iris_real --data <path_to_dataset>
```

# Rendering results
We use [Blender](https://www.blender.org) for generating our animations. It is important to generate for each frame of your animation an `*.ply` file containing modified Gaussians obtained from the training. You can find them in the output folder of your training under the name `step-<num_steps>_means.ply`. 

> ⚠️  It is very important to use only `*.ply` files since they don't change the order of vertices upon the save.

In the output folder of your trained model (usually named with the timestamp) create `camera_path` folder and put your `*.ply` file there. It is important to name them `00000.ply`, `00001.ply`, `00002.ply`, etc.

Now you are ready to go and you can start rednering. You have two options right here:
### Dataset Render
``` bash
iris-render dataset \
  --load-config outputs/<path_to_your_config.yml> \
  --output-path edits/<output_folder> \
  --rendered-output-names rgb \
  --selected-camera-idx <num_camera_from_test_data>
```
 - If you specify a camera index, all frames will be rendered from that viewpoint.
 - If not, the tool renders from all test-time cameras.

### Camera Path Render
``` bash
iris-render camera-path \
  --load-config outputs/<path_to_your_config.yml> \
  --camera-path-filename <camera_paths_folder> \
  --output-path edits/<output_folder> \
  --output-format images
```
-  The camera path here refers to what’s generated by the Nerfstudio viewer not your `*.ply` animation folder!

# Driving Gausses with a mesh
First thing that you need to do is to export the traingle soup from the model. We got you right there and we have prepared this command:
``` bash
iris-export triangles --load-config outputs/<path_to_your_config.yml>
```
This will create a traingle soup in the project output folder. In this output folder create another folder called `reference_meshes` put the edits of your Gausses in this folder in the same format as for rendering. Now this is important. Make sure that `triangle_soup.ply` and `00000.ply` represent your model in the exact same state (no modifications) since we will use those two as a reference. Other `*.ply` files can be in any configuration.

Now run the script:
``` bash
iris-export ply-from-edits --load-config outputs/<path_to_your_config.yml>
```
This will drive the Gausses and will create `camera_path` folder. Now you can proceed to normal rendering mentioned above.
